# Kaprekar-s-Constant-Step-Count
A C++ Algorithm to find the number of steps after which a given 4-digit integer converts into Kaprekar's Constant.


What is a KAPREKAR'S CONSTANT?

A Kaprekar constant is a number that can be obtained through a mathematical process that starts with any four-digit number (using at least two different digits), and repeatedly performs the following steps:

Arranging the digits in ascending and descending order to obtain two four-digit numbers
Subtracting the smaller number from the bigger number
Repeating the process with the result until the number is a constant value, which is called the Kaprekar constant.
The most well-known Kaprekar constant is 6174, which is obtained from any four-digit number (using at least two different digits) through the process. This process is also known as the Kaprekar routine. It is named after Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar, who described it in his book "The World of Homomorphs" in 1949.

Kaprekar constant is an example of a mathematical concept known as a "fixed point" or "attractor" which is a value that a function or process will always eventually converge to. The Kaprekar constant is also a good example of how simple mathematical operations can lead to complex and unexpected results.
